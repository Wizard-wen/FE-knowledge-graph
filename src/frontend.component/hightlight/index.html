          Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering,
          electronics engineering, information engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the
          design, construction, operation, and use of
          robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These
          technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots
          can be used in many situations
          and for lots of purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and
          deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space). Robots can take on any
          form but some are made to
          resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative
          behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition,
          and basically anything a human
          can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The
          concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into
          the functionality and
          potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century.[1] Throughout history, it has been
          frequently assumed that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like
          fashion. Today, robotics
          is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new
          robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are
          built to do jobs that are hazardous
          to people such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks.
          Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid. Robotics
          is a branch of engineering
          that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps with
          electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mechatronics, nanotechnology and bioengineering.
